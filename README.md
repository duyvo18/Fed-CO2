# Fed-CO2: Cooperation of Online and Offline Models for Severe Data Heterogeneity in Federated Learning
This is the PyTorch implemention.
## Usage
### Setup

We explore data heterogeneity issues in FL with label distribution skew and feature skew.

### Dataset

Benchmark datasets in this work include CIFAR10, CIFAR100, Digits, Office-Caltech10 and DomainNet

For CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 dataset, download and unzip data under 'label-skew/data' file catalog.

For Digits, Office-Caltech10 and DomainNet, put data in 'data' file catalog

### Train
